# seven-segment-led-display-control
This Verilog module implements a 4-bit binary to 7-segment display decoder. It takes a 4-bit input and drives a 7-segment display to show hexadecimal digits(0-9, a-f).

use cases :
Digital counters,
Hexadecimal display systems,
Embedded systems with 7-segment interfaces.

this code can be modified to work with a clock but it didn't seem necessary to me.
